# @politico/interactive-templates

Easy-bake templates from existing projects, stored on GitHub.

## Why this?

At POLITICO, we're always looking for projects we can replicate.

You might have used [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), npm scripts or something else in the past to help create the boilerplate code similar projects start from. [We](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-django) [have](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-graphics), [too](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-interactives). These are powerful templating tools, but in some cases they're overkill, and the overhead of building generators means only a few members of our team usually create them.

POLITICO interactive templates, or PIT, is designed to make creating templates easy for anyone. It also fits seamlessly in our GitHub-based workflow.

With PIT, anyone can easily create a reusable codebase and a simple interface for jump-starting new projects from old ones. PIT let's us quickly create templates at exactly the point where reuse makes sense. It's a Goldilocks tool for easy replication on our team.

## How it works

PIT is a local CLI tool for scaffolding a new project directory from a template hosted on GitHub.

You can turn any existing project hosted on GitHub into a PIT template by simply adding a `.pitrc` configuration file.

Once a project is templatized, you register it with your PIT CLI and start using it.

You can customize the CLI for any project by adding [Inquire.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) prompts and then use your user's answers to those questions to customize template files with [EJS](https://ejs.co/) template rendering.

Because your templates are always pulled down from GitHub, you can be sure your users always have the latest version whenever they start a new project.


## Quick start

1. Export a GitHub personal access with the `repo` scope token as `GITHUB_TOKEN`. You can learn more about acquiring a GitHub access token [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

  ```
  $ export GITHUB_TOKEN = [PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]
  ```

2. Install:

  ```
  $ npm install -g @politico/interactive-templates
  ```

3. Register a [PIT-configured template](docs/templates.md) hosted on GitHub by using the HTTPS URL for the repo:

  ```
  $ pit register GIT_URL_HERE
  ```

4. To start a new project, make an empty directory:

  ```
  $ mkdir MY_PROJECT_NAME
  $ cd MY_PROJECT_NAME
  ```

5. Then run PIT's new project command:

  ```
  $ pit new
  ```

6. Select your project template, answer any prompts and then BUILD! ðŸš€
